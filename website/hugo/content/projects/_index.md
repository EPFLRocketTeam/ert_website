header_text: "The EPFL Rocket Team was founded in 2017 by student engineers who wanted to put their theoretical skills into practice through an interdisciplinary project. They set themselves the challenge of participating in the largest international rocket launch competition; the Spaceport America Cup, which takes place every year in the United States of America. Since then, our association has grown significantly and brings together young, ambitious and enterprising space enthusiasts who wish to train for careers in aerospace."
