  <h5>Gimbal Module</h5>

  <p>This year, ICARUS project is developing its very first Hopper-type rocket allowing to maintain stability by directing the thrust of the engine and aiming at propulsively landing vertically. For this, a gimbal module allowing to redirect the thrust by two degrees of freedom has been designed. The objective is now to refine the design and to manufacture it before testing it. Ideally, a small team of 2 students with practical knowledge in mechanics and electronics would be perfect to work on this module. It is also possible to work on it as a credited semester project.</p>
