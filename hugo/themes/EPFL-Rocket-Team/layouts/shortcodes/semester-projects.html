                    PROJECT DESCRIPTION

In order to dimension the structural parts of its rockets, the EPFL Rocket Team mainly uses structural simulations based on the Finite Element Method (FEM). Simulating an entire structural segment (like the one in the image below) is a difficult task, in part because the contacts between all of the different parts introduce a lot of nonlinearities. Moreover, using destructive testing to verify/validate simulations can be very expensive.

A common method used in aerospace engineering to verify/validate large coupled FE models is to compare simulated and experimental modal analysis. By experimentally extracting the modal frequencies and mode shapes and correcting the FE models until the simulation results match with the experiment, it is possible to verify and correct large coupled FE models in a non-destructive manner.
