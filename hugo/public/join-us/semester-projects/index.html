SPRING 2025 Competition Project Structure Structural assembly FE model validation via experimental modal analysis Experimental analysis of rocket tanks sloshing and vortex buildup Manufacturing Technique for composite parts Study, Design, and Analysis of Anti-Buckling Rings: Material Selection, Production, and Performance Testing PROJECT DESCRIPTION In order to dimension the structural parts of its rockets, the EPFL Rocket Team mainly uses structural simulations based on the Finite Element Method (FEM). Simulating an entire structural segment (like the one in the image below) is a difficult task, in part because the contacts between all of the different parts introduce a lot of nonlinearities. Moreover, using destructive testing to verify/validate simulations can be very expensive. A common method used in aerospace engineering to verify/validate large coupled FE models is to compare simulated and experimental modal analysis. By experimentally extracting the modal frequencies and mode shapes and correcting the FE models until the simulation results match with the experiment, it is possible to verify and correct large coupled FE models in a non-destructive manner. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The EPFL Rocket Team is currently developing a new class of rockets aimed at launching at an altitude of 9 km during the EuRoC 25 student rocketry competition and to launch at an altitude of 30 km in 2026. These launch vehicles are propelled by a biliquid engine. Two cylindrical aluminum tanks are located along the rocket length to store the propellant and oxidizer. Recovery Mission Analysis and Feasibility Study for the Recovery System of a Suborbital Rocket Icarus Project Design, manufacture and testing of a Reaction Control Wheel Preliminary Design of Active Control on a Suborbital Rocket through the use of Canards Design and Implementation of a Multi-Point Vibration Sensing System PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The EPFL Rocket Team is developing a Vertical Takeoff, Vertical Landing (VTVL) Hopper named Icarus. Its aim is to perform “hops” : brief, low-altitude (maximum 5 metres), vertical trajectories with hovering time at the apogee. To achieve precise thrust vectoring, Icarus is equipped with a gimbal system that redirects the engine’s thrust, allowing for stabilized control during flight. Given this setup, understanding the vehicle’s vibrational behavior is critical for ensuring the integrity of the structure, the performance of the gimbal, and the reliability of the avionics system.

                    PROJECT DESCRIPTION

                    In order to dimension the structural parts of its rockets, the EPFL Rocket Team mainly uses structural simulations based on the Finite Element Method (FEM). Simulating an entire structural segment (like the one in the image below) is a difficult task, in part because the contacts between all of the different parts introduce a lot of nonlinearities. Moreover, using destructive testing to verify/validate simulations can be very expensive.

                    A common method used in aerospace engineering to verify/validate large coupled FE models is to compare simulated and experimental modal analysis. By experimentally extracting the modal frequencies and mode shapes and correcting the FE models until the simulation results match with the experiment, it is possible to verify and correct large coupled FE models in a non-destructive manner.

                    PROJECT DESCRIPTION<br>

                    The EPFL Rocket Team is currently developing a new class of rockets aimed at launching at an altitude of 9 km during the EuRoC 25 student rocketry competition and to launch at an altitude of 30 km in 2026. These launch vehicles are propelled by a biliquid engine. Two cylindrical aluminum tanks are located along the rocket length to store the propellant and oxidizer.

                    The EPFL Rocket Team is developing a Vertical Takeoff, Vertical Landing (VTVL) Hopper named Icarus. Its aim is to perform “hops” : brief, low-altitude (maximum 5 metres), vertical trajectories with hovering time at the apogee. To achieve precise thrust vectoring, Icarus is equipped with a gimbal system that redirects the engine’s thrust, allowing for stabilized control during flight. Given this setup, understanding the vehicle’s vibrational behavior is critical for ensuring the integrity of the structure, the performance of the gimbal, and the reliability of the avionics system.
