<h5 style="color: #da291c">Avionics</h5>
<p>
The Avionics allows the rocket to figure out and send to the ground information on the rockets status (position, speed, acceleration, etc).<br>
The Avionics is also in charge of triggering recovery events to release the parachute at the right time.
And finally, according to the engine used, it can also act as intermediary between propulsion systems and some of the ground segment systems.

<h5 style="color: #da291c">Recovery</h5>
<p>
The purpose of the Recovery subsystem is to slow down the rocket’s fall to ensure a safe landing after its ascent.<br>
This is usually done with parachutes, but experimentation is always welcome!
</p>
<h6 style="font-size: 26px">Available <span style="colour: #da291c">Roles</span>:</h6>
<h5 style="color: #da291c">Structures</h5>
<p>
The Structure Subsystem is in charge of designing and producing the rocket’s fuselage, as well as ensuring that it is capable of surviving mechanical and thermal stresses before, during, and after the flight.
</p>
<h6 style="font-size: 26px">Available <span style="colour: #da291c">Roles</span>:</h6>
<h5 style="color: #da291c">Propulsion</h5>
<p>
The Propulsion subsystem is where the magic happens. Fire comes out on one end, pushing the rocket towards its objective.<br>
This year, the team is aiming to fly its very first Liquid engine with Ethanol as fuel and Nitrous Oxide as the oxidizer.
</p>
<h6 style="font-size: 26px">Available <span style="colour: #da291c">Roles</span>:</h6>
<h5 style="color: #da291c">Payload</h5>
<p>
The Payload is the sub-system in charge of imagining, developing and integrating the scientific experiment powered by the rocket.<br>
This years experiment is not yet chosen, give us your ideas!

<h6 style="font-size: 26px">Available <span style="colour: #da291c">Roles</span>:</h6>
<h5 style="color: #da291c">Ground Segment</h5>
<p>
The Ground Segment subsystem is in charge of all ground operations before, during and after the launch.<br>
This includes, among others, the management of a Ground Station equipped with radios and antennas, as well as a 9m tall Launch Rail.
</p>
<h6 style="font-size: 26px">Available <span style="colour: #da291c">Roles</span>:</h6>
<h5 style="color: #da291c">Flight Dynamics</h5>
<p>
The Flight Dynamics subsystem is in charge of all simulations related to the rocket in general.
It is in particular flight simulations with commercial tools as well as with home-made simulators, and fluidic studies on the aerodynamics of the rocket.<br>
Simulations performed are, amongst others, predictions for the rockets trajectory, statistical drop-zones for nominal and off-nominal trajectories, aerodynamics/thermal/fluid analysis on the airflow around the rocket at various velocities.

<p>This project involves building a relatively simple rocket in teams of 5-7 students. This project allows to learn the basics of rocketry while learning to work in a team. It is mostly aimed to the first and possibly second year students of EPFL. </p>

<p>All sections are welcome.</p>
