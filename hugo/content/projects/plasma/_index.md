header_text: "Electric propulsion is becoming the backbone of modern space mobility, and the Plasma Group of the EPFL Rocket Team is bringing this technology to the student world. Our team designs, builds and tests several classes of plasma engines such as pulsed plasma thrusters, arcjets and Hall effect thrusters, along with the power electronics and ground facilities needed to run them. This project blends research level engineering with hands on prototyping, giving students the chance to explore real spacecraft propulsion systems and contribute to the next generation of space technology."

  - key: " Our team reached a major milestone this year by successfully firing a pulsed plasma thruster inside a chamber pumped down to five times ten to the minus five mbar, demonstrating stable plasma pulses in true space like vacuum. This work was consolidated into our first peer reviewed conference publication at the International Electric Propulsion Conference, where we presented our full PPT architecture, pulse characterisation and system design.

# Project components

A hollow cathode is the electron source of a Hall effect thruster. Inside a heated tube, a small gas flow is ionised and emits a dense stream of electrons into the discharge channel. These electrons neutralise the ion beam and sustain the plasma inside the thruster. It is one of the most delicate components and requires precise thermal control and material selection.

{{< component-section component="Hall effect thruster" image="/images/originalQuality/plasma-het.png" 
image2="/images/originalQuality/plasma-het-2.png" object-fit="scale-down" >}}
A Hall effect thruster accelerates ions using a radial magnetic field and an axial electric field. Electrons are trapped in a circular motion, ionise the propellant and create a stable plasma region. The ions are then accelerated outwards at very high speed to generate thrust. This technology is widely used for satellites due to its high efficiency and long lifetime.

A thruster only matters if you can measure it, qualify it and fly it. Our system integration work covers everything needed to bring plasma engines into real mission environments. This includes the full integration of our pulsed plasma thruster into a one point five unit Cubesat frame, the development of precision thrust measurement setups and the design of test benches for the next generation of Hall and arcjet systems. This branch ensures that every engine we build can be characterised, compared and prepared for future in orbit demonstrations.
