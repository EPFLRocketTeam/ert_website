# Rocket components

{{< tabs-state initial-tab="NOSECONE" >}}

{{< component-section component="NOSECONE" image="/images/originalQuality/firehorn-image1.png" >}}
Made from CFRP (Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer), the nosecone houses the payload and supports the Acoustic Levitation Scientific Experiment. CFRP provides high strength and low weight.

{{< component-section component="RECOVERY BAY" image="/images/originalQuality/firehorn-image1.png" >}}
Constructed with CFRP, this bay contains the reefed parachute and is designed to handle over 30g deceleration forces.
{{< /component-section >}}

{{< component-section component="AVIONICS BAY" image="/images/originalQuality/firehorn-image2.png" >}}
Built with GFRP (Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymer), this section includes omnidirectional antennas and the flight computer for controlling the rocket.

{{< component-section component="PRESSURANT BAY" image="/images/originalQuality/firehorn-image2.png" >}}
Equipped with a 400-bar COPV (Composite Overwrapped Pressure Vessel) and a Bang-Bang Pressure Regulator to manage pressure during flight.
{{< /component-section >}}

{{< component-section component="TANKS" image="/images/originalQuality/firehorn-image3.png" >}}
Made of 2050 and 2195 aluminium, the tanks are rated for over 60 bar operational pressure. CFRP aerocovers protect external plumbing, and integrated flight cameras monitor the system.

{{< component-section component="INTERNAL STRUCTURE" image="/images/originalQuality/firehorn-image4.png" >}}
The internal structure includes CFRP rods, anti-buckling rings, and 3D-printed interface rings for added support and durability.
{{< /component-section >}}

{{< component-section component="ENGINE BAY" image="/images/originalQuality/firehorn-image4.png" >}}
Home to the 7.5kN Ethanol-Liquid Oxygen engine, this bay features cryogenic-rated plumbing, valves, and CFRP fins. It interfaces with the ground segment for launch operations.

# Milestones

One of the significant milestones to our journey was the project’s PDR (Preliminary Design Review) held in March, where stakeholders were presented with the initial vehicle design. A comprehensive PDR documentation, covering the technical design and project management details since September, totaling 267 pages, has been sent to stakeholders. In parallel, work on assembling a preliminary CAD model of the Firehorn rocket is underway, providing a tangible visualization of previously abstract technical requirements.
