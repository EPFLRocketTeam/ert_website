# Milestones

One of the significant milestones to our journey was the project’s PDR (Preliminary Design Review) held in March, where stakeholders were presented with the initial vehicle design. A comprehensive PDR documentation, covering the technical design and project management details since September, totaling 267 pages, has been sent to stakeholders. In parallel, work on assembling a preliminary CAD model of the Firehorn rocket is underway, providing a tangible visualization of previously abstract technical requirements.
