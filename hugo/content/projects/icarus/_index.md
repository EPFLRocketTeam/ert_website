header_text: "Founded in 2020, ICARUS is a research and development project on active attitude control technologies for future rocket teams. These technologies are crucial throughout the flight to control the trajectory and its smooth progress. The main objective is also to get our rockets back by landing them propulsively by reigniting their engines in the same way SpaceX is known to do, thus training students in technologies that are crucial to lowering the cost to reach space."

# Specifications

Our mission is to create a vehicle capable of propulsive landing as well as a platform for EPFL Rocket Team to develop technologies pertaining to active control and thrust vectoring for use in future vehicles. Such an usage would be a dedicated module on-board the next Firehorn-class rocket. We aim to foster learning opportunities for students and bring our association closer to space through innovative engineering and collaborative efforts.

# GNC Algorithms

Even though the ICARUS project works on concrete technologies, the base of the project remains the development of the various control, navigation and guidance algorithms. These algorithms aim to control the stability of the rocket as well as to optimize its trajectory throughout the flight in order to reach its objective, and in a near future to succeed in landing it.

Due to the complexity of the task and the number of parameters taken into account, the team chose to use predictive control techniques based on a dynamic model previously developed on a simulator. From the flight data collected by our avionics, this technique makes it possible to anticipate in quasi real time the future evolution of the state of the rocket and thus to optimize the control instructions.

# Components
