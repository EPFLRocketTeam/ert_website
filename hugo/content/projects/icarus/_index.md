header_text: "Founded in 2020, ICARUS is a research and development project on active attitude control technologies for future rocket teams. These technologies are crucial throughout the flight to control the trajectory and its smooth progress. The main objective is also to get our rockets back by landing them propulsively by reigniting their engines in the same way SpaceX is known to do, thus training students in technologies that are crucial to lowering the cost to reach space."
