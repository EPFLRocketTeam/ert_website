header_text: "Firehorn 2 is the EPFL Rocket Team's second cryogenic bi-liquid rocket, building on its predecessor Firehorn 1's architecture. This project aims to launch in the Liquid 3km category of the 2026 edition of the European Rocketry Challenge (EuRoC), followed by a 9km launch in 2027. The architecture has been designed for a 30km flight, which will be the culminating point of the Firehorn architecture."

# Rocket components

{{< component-section component="NOSECONE" image="/images/originalQuality/firehorn-image1.png" >}}
Made from CFRP (Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer), the nosecone houses the "Payload Guide," featuring an extensive suite of sensors for dynamic characterization. CFRP provides high strength and low weight.

{{< component-section component="RECOVERY BAY" image="/images/originalQuality/firehorn-image1.png" >}}
Constructed with CFRP, this bay contains the reefed parachute and is designed to handle over 30g deceleration forces.
{{< /component-section >}}

{{< component-section component="AVIONICS BAY" image="/images/originalQuality/firehorn-image2.png" >}}
Built with GFRP (Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymer), this section includes omnidirectional antennas and the flight computer for controlling the rocket.

{{< component-section component="PRESSURANT BAY" image="/images/originalQuality/firehorn-image2.png" >}}
Equipped with a 400-bar COPV (Composite Overwrapped Pressure Vessel) and a Bang-Bang Pressure Regulator to manage pressure during flight.
{{< /component-section >}}

{{< component-section component="TANKS" image="/images/originalQuality/firehorn-image3.png" >}}
Made of 2050 and 2195 aluminium, the tanks are rated for over 60 bar operational pressure. CFRP aerocovers protect external plumbing, and integrated flight cameras monitor the system.
{{< /component-section >}}

{{< component-section component="INTERNAL STRUCTURE" image="/images/originalQuality/firehorn-image4.png" >}}
The internal structure includes CFRP rods, anti-buckling rings, and 3D-printed interface rings for added support and durability.
{{< /component-section >}}

{{< component-section component="ENGINE BAY" image="/images/originalQuality/firehorn-image4.png" >}}
Home to the 7.5kN Ethanol-Liquid Oxygen engine, this bay features cryogenic-rated plumbing, valves, and CFRP fins. It interfaces with the ground segment for launch operations.

# Milestones

This project started with the Firehorn architecture's maiden flight at EuRoC 2025. Now, we are looking forward to a Critical Design Review (CDR) in late December, which will be followed by an intense period of testing and qualification in the second semester, highlighted by motor ignitions, destructive structural testing, and recovery drop tests. We aim for Vertical Static Fire Tests (VSFTs) in late July.
