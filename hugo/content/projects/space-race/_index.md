# About
As a follow-up to Project IO, Space Race is ERT’s educational project to form those who want to go deeper in rocketry:
The 2024-25 edition of the Space Race project marked an exciting chapter in aerospace innovation within the ERT community. last year, 80 members participated, divided into ten teams. The challenge centered around building a Level 1 rocket compliant with Tripoli Amateur Launchers Association standards. Teams also had the option to deploy a CanSat at the apogee, while some chose to launch and safely recover a raw egg. The edition showcased a diverse range of designs and strategies.
Throughout the programme, experienced members mentored the students, ensuring high standards in design and engineering and fostering valuable knowledge transfer to the next generation of aerospace innovators.
